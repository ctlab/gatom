Description: This package implements a metabolic network analysis pipeline to 
    identify an active metabolic module based on high throughput data. 
    The pipeline takes as input transcriptional and/or metabolic data 
    and finds a metabolic subnetwork (module) most regulated between the two 
    conditions of interest. The package further provides functions for module 
    post-processing, annotation and visualization.
